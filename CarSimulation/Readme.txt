Chun-Hsueh Lee Take-home Assignment (C++)


Code structure:
1. Define a base class “Average_car” which has all basic members and member functions. All parameters are declared as “protected” and member functions are “public”, for the reason of encapsulation and abstraction.
2. Three derived classes: “Slow_car”, “Fast_car”, “Fancy_car” all inherited the mother class “Average_car”. Each contains their specific parameters and unique member functions, as described in the assignment.
3. Declare a unique structure “ansStruct” to return all the car status when the “showState()” function is called.
4. Test the code using “Catch2”, compare the return value (the status of a car object) and the ideal output.


Instruction:
1. Simply type “make” command in the terminal in /ChunHsuehLee_takehome folder. 
2. Run ./main for showing the operation required in the “Problem Statement”.
3. Run ./test_car for testing more cases.
